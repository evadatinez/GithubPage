      <description>This notebook contains the code I presented for the BTSA book club session on the 11th August 2020. You can find the description of the session (&amp;amp; other meetup sessions) here.
It is an introductory notebook to create predictions of the time series data provided and measure their performance using Facebook Prophet.
Setup and data exploration import numpy as np import pandas as pd from fbprophet import Prophet import matplotlib.</description>

      <description>Lately, I have been on maternity leave and people kept saying to me “sleep when the baby sleeps” but then after surviving the first months I thought “yeah… cook when the baby cooks, develop your career when the baby develops his/her career?”.

      <description>In my first post I would like to share with you my experience as PhD in Mathematics in Berlin.
Starting a PhD is not easy. First of all, you have to apply to many places that might be famous for your research area but it is hard to picture how the experience will look like when you finally get your acceptance letter. This is why the Berlin Mathematical School (BMS) compiles testimonials in their website, to show prospective students what doing a Math PhD in Berlin is like.</description>
