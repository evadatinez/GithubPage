<p>My baby has passed the 1 year old mark recently. Because of that, I have made a trip back in time looking at the pictures of my little bundle of joy when he was just born. As soon as I checked the first pictures at the hospital I realized he has changed so much, he looks like a completely different baby (OMG should I say toddler already?).</p>
<p>The first birthday of my little one made me think of how many things have been really surprising for me (&amp; us as a family) during this period. There are quite many and I have tried to summarize the top 12 most surprising ones to share them in this post.</p>
<p>Note that this is based on my (our) personal experience. I am always up to exchange impressions, thoughts, concerns‚Ä¶ so don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me if you are up for it too. üòÑ</p>
<div id="heres-my-top12" class="section level1">
<h1>Here‚Äôs my top12</h1>
<div id="the-birth-i-felt-i-was-only-prepared-for-everything-to-go-well" class="section level2">
<h2>1. The birth: I felt I was only ‚Äúprepared‚Äù for everything to go well</h2>
<p>No matter how much I heard about birth complications, emergency C-sections, what to do if your baby has any health issues at birth‚Ä¶ it all sounds like something with so little probability that I was listening and hoping it wouldn‚Äôt happen to me‚Ä¶ so somehow my brain pushed that information to a corner at the back of my brain.</p>
<p>So in the end I felt I was only prepared for everything to go well (which is hard enough) and any unexpected complication felt hard <span class="math inline">\(\times 10\)</span>. The good learning was that once in the business, epidural &amp; c-section were a lot less scary than I had expected. The scariest thing is when you see the doctors worried about the health of your baby. Then you forget about the perfect birth of your dreams you described at your birth plan and just want them to remove the baby from your belly (really, no matter how at that moment) to make sure he is fine.</p>
</div>
<div id="postpartum-depression-is-a-real-very-serious-thing" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Postpartum depression is a real &amp; very serious thing</h2>
<p>Despite the birth was a bit bumpy, everything after that went quite well (up to some breastfeeding issues I mention later in this post). Still the first weeks (and honestly up to the first 3 months) were really hard to handle.</p>
<p>I was a hormones soup, sleep deprived, working hard to breastfeed and healing from c-section‚Ä¶ honestly, I felt like a feeding machine and Papa was the cool parent playing so I would never bond like that with the baby. I felt Papa was the one who knew what he was doing and was much more calm than me when the baby was crying. Moreover, every little thing made me cry. Papa was about to go back to work after 2 months and I felt so scared, like I really couldn‚Äôt do it alone.</p>
<p>Until I opened up, I talked to my partner and guess what? He was feeling I was the cool one, bonding with the baby while feeding. At every little crisis he felt I knew better what to do and was more calm (really!). So I realized how much both of us were new in this game and how important is communication.</p>
<p>It all improved even more when I started talking to other mums. We all had similar feelings during this period. Opening up was key. To see other couples struggling with the same things really made us feel much more comfortable with our struggles. It all was part of the journey and we were (and in particular I was) totally able to handle it.</p>
<p>Now I look back and I realize how easy &amp; how dangerous would have been to not share my doubts &amp; concerns. Every month comes with new challenges and having the right energy to face them is key. So please please PLEASE seek for help if you feel you can‚Äôt make it, because YOU CAN.</p>
</div>
<div id="breastfeeding-is-a-lot-harder-than-i-expected" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Breastfeeding is a lot harder than I expected</h2>
<p>This is gonna be a little longer, because I want to share my very personal experience in this matter.</p>
<p>While pregnant, I took the typical pre-natal course, read books, etc. &amp; I decided I was going to breastfeed my baby. It was clear to me it was the best choice and I was dreaming on the day he was born he would simply grab the breast and eat super smoothly. Later, I would go to a cafe and my baby would be hungry and I simply would feed him there casually and we would all be super happy.</p>
<p>The magic day arrived and the first obstacle: c-section. No panic, a bit of breast pumping and I will catch up. Then small complications made necessary to feed the baby with a bit of bottle milk now and then because my production was not increasing fast enough. Also stress does not help. Later got a prescription for renting a pumping machine for home.</p>
<p>As soon as we went home with my breasts covered in Lanolin (because the first days it really hurts) my breastfeeding improved a lot but it did not feel enough. The baby was constantly asking for food and he took hours nursing until exhausted. He slept maybe for 30-60min and cried hungry again. He was only having mothermilk during the day but he had 1 meal with formula at night (essentially it provided me the only 3 straight hours of sleep in the day). It was very exhausting and very frustrating. Of course we were not able to walk out home to look for a coffee and fulfill my pre-birth fantasy.</p>
<p>I started looking for help and I got very different suggestions: ‚ÄúGive up the bottle and focus only on breastfeeding even if baby needs to eat every hour until you catch up‚Äù vs ‚ÄúGive up breastfeeding and focus on having your baby full and happy with formula milk‚Äù. I was so obsessed with breastfeeding‚Ä¶ it became like a religion. I found lots of testimonials in blogs succeeding in situations that I believed they were much worse than ours I thought: ‚Äúwe should be able to do it‚Äù. But we weren‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Eventually I discovered there are people dedicated to this matter: Breastfeeding consultants. An amazing woman came home, looked at my baby nursing, gave us great feedback to improve the latching position and some rules to keep up balancing the time dedicated to breastfeeding-pumping-resting. This plus taking 92342967 natural remedies to boost milk production made us catch up during the second month but there was a factor I did not expect. My baby is quite big and so is his appetite, so he kept growing and being more hungry faster than my milk production could handle.</p>
<p>At some point I had my Dr‚Äôs checkup after c-section and guess what: she was surprised I could breastfeed at all, because I had c-section and some hormonal problems during pregnancy. That made me feel kind of released since that meant that it was a real physical challenge for my body to produce milk at all and felt much more empowered. Then I decided I would continue the pumping routine until the baby would be 3 months old. Then, I stopped pumping and combined breastfeed and bottle for as long as it lasted.</p>
<p>It worked for another month and a half. During this time I had to face another of the postpartum nightmares: hair loss. I was loosing my hair and it was not growing back, so I had a blood test and guess what: my Dr.¬†was surprised I could breastfeed at all with the result of the test (I had very low levels of lots of things).</p>
<p>So on one hand side, I had to hear comments about how a bad mother I was for giving up breastfeeding, while on the other hand others were surprised that I could breastfeed at all. In the end the only thing that matters to me is what makes my baby healthy AND happy. So I am really proud of having worked so hard for the time I did and this brings me to the next super important point.</p>
</div>
<div id="theres-no-price" class="section level2">
<h2>4. There‚Äôs no price</h2>
<p>After all the breastfeeding nightmare I am proud I could provide some mother milk to my little one for the first few months. If there is a next time, my learning would be to take it much more easy and focus on the baby. When he is happy I am happy and everything is much easier. There are mothers who can not (or even don‚Äôt want to) breastfeed their babies at all and they grow as healthy and as smart (e.g.¬†me!).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I keep worrying and comparing my baby‚Äôs milestones to others. I think it is inevitable to worry when your 3 data points around you already roll over and your baby does not have any interest at all‚Ä¶ But really, <strong>there‚Äôs no price</strong>. There‚Äôs no scientific evidence that being the first baby reaching certain milestones will make them more successful in any aspect in the future. Time intervals to reach each milestone are quite wide and if my baby‚Äôs pediatrician is happy with his development so am I.</p>
<p>On top of it, something that helps me is to read frequently posts in groups of parents (eg in Facebook). In this way for example I discovered that there are babies who never crawl at all and start walking directly as well as many useful tips for daily life. I find it is really helpful to enlarge a bit the set of data points I observe (always with a grain of salt, of course).</p>
</div>
<div id="accept-my-schedule-is-not-mine-anymore" class="section level2">
<h2>5. Accept: My schedule is not mine anymore</h2>
<p>Some years ago I was told about this one by a close friend of mine and I could not really understand her. I thought ‚Äúwell, you had a baby, what did you expect?‚Äù.</p>
<p>And yet it happened to me‚Ä¶ Small things required a huge effort from my side and every time I would sit down and open my computer a baby cry would start. Fun fact: I did not have a warm tea in the whole winter 19/20. Not because I did not prepare any (I was having at least one a day). It was because every time I had to let it cool down my baby cried for any reason and I completely forgot about it.</p>
<p>Eventually I was really frustrated and I remembered that conversation some years ago. After sharing these feelings with my partner, he encouraged me to benefit form the pumping machine we had at home, prepare a couple of bottles and go take some time for myself. I could go have a lunch with the colleagues form the office, had a coffee with a friend, attended a couple of Meetups (of course, all these before Corona) and even wrote blogposts, started some small personal projects‚Ä¶ Communication is key to coordinate. Thanks to his support, although everything takes more effort than before, it is still doable.</p>
