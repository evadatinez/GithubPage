      <description>In my first post I would like to share with you my experience as PhD in Mathematics in Berlin.
Starting a PhD is not easy. First of all, you have to apply to many places that might be famous for your research area but it is hard to picture how the experience will look like when you finally get your acceptance letter. This is why the Berlin Mathematical School (BMS) compiles testimonials in their website, to show prospective students what doing a Math PhD in Berlin is like.</description>

      <description>Dr. Eva Martínez Mathematician and Data Analyst    Math Slam @BMS Friday 2014   
What is Datínez? After my PhD, my next big project consisted on developing my programming skills. I started with R, moved to Python, then to sql (tried many flavours: MySQL, Postgresql, Redshift, &amp;hellip;) and back to R, a bit of Javascript&amp;hellip; I learned a lot discussing with my colleagues, attending super cool meetups, reading super useful blogs here and there&amp;hellip; So Datínez is just me: Data Martínez.</description>
